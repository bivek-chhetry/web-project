        <p class="detail" id="one">A friend in need is a friend indeed’, that is what the definition of a true friend
            who will never leave you during your hardships, success, and failure. We can choose our friends. Real
            friends always share and support each other. They feel joyful when we are happy, and during our sadness,
            they also share sadness with us. True friendship is all about sharing things, making mistakes, fighting for
            silly things, but again hugging to support each other. Friendship is an essential thing for a happy life.
            Whenever you are in worry, a chat with a friend takes out all problems away. That is the strength of
            friendship.</p>
        <p class="detail" id="two">Friendships are sometimes more durable than the relationship of love. Even though the
            definition of friendship varies from person to person, the core meaning behind it is the same for everybody.
            Life is empty without a friend. So when you gain a true friend, make sure you cherish it with all your
            heart. The person with a real friend, with whom all the things can be shared, are the luckiest in the world.
            A friend will never judge you, and they will never stop scolding you if you are wrong. But whatever the
            situation be, they will always be there to support you</p>
        <p class="detail" id="three">A true friend will always want your happiness. A life without a good friend is
            merely empty. Honesty is the key factor to maintain the friendship forever. For understanding each other’s
            emotions, you have to be completely honest with each other. Patience and acceptance are also other factors
            for friendship to last long. Understanding the differences as well as accepting them is what a maturity
            factor in a friendship. Friendship will fulfill you with sweet memories that you can cherish for the rest of
            your life. The unbounded love, as well as care, is what makes the relationship between two friends strong.
